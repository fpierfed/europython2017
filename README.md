Code for the Euro Python 2017 Asynchronous Programming With Python Training

As you will see, the repository is heavily tagged. This is done to allow folks to follow the tutorial and the code evolution.

One word of caution: this is **demo-quality** code. If you use it anywhere near a production environment you deserve everything that will happen to you :-)


## Note to Windows users
If you try and run the examples on Windows, you will likely get an errors saying that **sleep** cannot be found. In these cases, please replace occurrences of ```sleep``` in the examples with ```sleep.py``` provided in this repository. I hope this helps.
